 - Java 17 is minimal supported* version
 - Gradle 8.4 is minimal supported* version
 - PIT 1.19.5 by default
 - Ability to build and run with JDK 24
 - Initial support for Gradle 9 (no warnings with 9.0-m9)
 - Ability to override verbose from command line - [#341](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/pull/341) - PR by [pfoerd](https://github.com/Pfoerd)
 - Define plugins in build.gradle instead of .properties files - [#373](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/pull/373) - PR by [mitchellmebane](https://github.com/mitchellmebane)

 - Upgrade Gradle wrapper to 8.14.2

**Compatibility notes**. Java 17+ and Gradle 8.4+ are the minimal supported versions.

**PLEASE NOTE**. This version is just a refresh variant of 1.15.0, compatible with latest Gradle version (8.14/9.0). No PIT 1.19.0 features parity is developed.

Missing features:
1. Automatic releasing from CI to Maven Central and Gradle Plugins (as previously used CDeliveryBoy is not compatible with Gradle 7+).
2. Releasing also to Maven Central (not just only to Gradle Plugins).

Thanks to all the contributors to this release: @Pfoerd, @mitchellmebane, @ThomGeG, @mfvanek.


## 1.15.0 - 2023-09-28

 - Automatically add `junit-platform-launcher` dependency to `testRuntimeOnly` for JUnit Platform projects - [#337](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/337) - help from [Björn Kautler](https://github.com/Vampire)
 - Remove deprecated `Project.getConvention()` usage (in Gradle 8.2+) - [#343](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/343)
 - PIT 1.15.0 by default
 - Basic regression testing with Gradle up to 8.3

**Compatibility notes**
Starting with PIT 1.14.0 (with pitest-junit-plugin 1.2.0+) `junit-platform-launcher` is no longer shaded and has to be explicitly added to avoid:
"Minion exited abnormally due to UNKNOWN_ERROR" or "NoClassDefFoundError: org.junit.platform.launcher.core.LauncherFactory".

As an experimental (incubating) feature, `junit-platform-launcher` is automatically added to the `testRuntimeOnly` configuration for the JUnit Platform projects.

**PLEASE NOTE**. This feature is experimental and might not work as expected in some corner cases. In that situation, just disable it with `addJUnitPlatformLauncher = false` and add the required dependency 'junit-platform-launcher' in a proper version to 'testRuntimeOnly' manually. More information: https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/337


## 1.9.11 - 2022-11-27

 - Support for thresholds in aggregated metrics (requires PIT 1.9.9+) - [#319](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/319) - PR by [pfoerd](https://github.com/Pfoerd)
 - Support for `verbosity` flag, "spinner" disabled by default - [#267](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/267) - PR by [Carsten Otto](https://github.com/C-Otto)
 - PIT 1.9.11 by default
 - Do not produce timestamped reports by default for PIT 1.9.6+ - suggestion by [Siddardha Bezawada](https://github.com/SidB3)
 - Minimal supported PIT version is 1.7.1 (due to "verbosity" flag used by default)
 - Deprecate `verbose` flag - `verbosity` is much more versatile, especially when used from the Gradle plugin

**Compatibility notes**
1. Due to the usage of the "verbosity" flag by default, the minimal supported PIT version is 1.7.1 (released 2021-09-29).
2. Due to the changes in PIT 1.9.6, timestamped reported are not generated by default (with PIT 1.9.6+). It still can be enforced in the GPP configuration.


## 1.9.0 - 2022-08-19

 - PIT 1.9.4 by default (requires pitest-junit5-plugin 1.0.0!)
 - Deprecate support for JDK 8 - [#299](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/299)
 - Support for `inputEncoding` and `outputEncoding` (named in plugin `inputCharset` and `outputCharset`) - [#310](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/310)
 - Add pitest dependencies only during configuration resolution - [#313](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/313) - PR by [Ian O'Malley](https://github.com/omalleyian)
 - Improve build cache hit cache with relative path - [#315](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/315) - PR by [Siddardha Bezawada](https://github.com/SidB3)
 - Remove (optional) `dependencyDistance` configuration parameter removed in PIT 1.9.0 - [#311](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/311)


**Compatibility notes**
1. Due to the plugin API changes in PIT 1.9.0, the new pitest-junit5-plugin 1.0.0 is required (other PIT plugins - if used - also need to be upgraded).
2. The plugin is released with JDK 11. Source/class compatibility is still set to JDK 8, but this might change without notice.


## 1.7.4 - 2022-03-12

 - Do not pass `--testPlugin` for PIT 1.6.7+ for forward compatibility - [#277](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/277)
 - Deprecate `testPlugin` configuration parameter (not needed in [PIT 1.6.7+](https://github.com/hcoles/pitest/pull/900), to be removed in PIT 1.8.0) - [#277](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/277)
 - PIT 1.7.4 by default
 - Upgrade Gradle wrapper to 6.9.2
 - Test for exclusion of certain mutators - [#303](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/pull/303) - PR by [Narendra Pathai](https://github.com/npathai)

**Compatibility notes**:
1. The `testPlugin` configuration parameter is deprecated and should not be used. In fact, starting with 1.6.7 it is no longer used (it is enough to add the PIT plugin as a buildscript dependency or just set `junit5PluginVersion` to use the JUnit 5 plugin). In addition, that property is planned to be removed in PIT 1.8.0.
2. Using `junit5PluginVersion` no longer internally set `testPlugin` property. For using with old PIT (<1.6.7) it is required to set it explicitly in configuration.


## 1.7.0 - 2021-09-20

 - Support for Gradle configuration cache - [#249](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/249) - PR by [David Burstrom](https://github.com/davidburstrom)
 - Turn on cacheability for `PitestTask` - [#67](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/67) - PR by [David Burstrom](https://github.com/davidburstrom)
 - PIT 1.7.0 by default
 - Fix deprecation warnings in Gradle 7 - [#283](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/283) - PR by [Mike Duigou](https://github.com/bondolo)
 - Bump minimal supported Gradle version to 6.4 - required to fix deprecation warnings in Gradle 7
 - Remove unused `maxMutationsPerClass` configuration parameter - [#266](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/266)
 - Regression tests for JUnit Jupiter 5.8 (with JUnit Platform 1.8) and pitest-junit5-plugin 0.15
 - Upgrade Gradle wrapper to 6.9.1
 - Switch CI from defunct travis-ci.org to travis-ci.com

**Compatibility notes**:
1. Gradle 6.4+ is required (to fix deprecation warnings in Gradle 7)
2. Not directly related with this plugin, but keep in mind that JUnit Jupiter 5.8 (JUnit Platform 1.8) requires pitest-junit5-plugin 0.15+, while 5.7 (1.7) requires <=0.14. Set right plugin version for JUnit 5 version used in your project to avoid runtime errors (such as `NoSuchMethodError: 'java.util.Optional org.junit.platform.commons.util.AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation(java.lang.Class, java.lang.Class, boolean)'` - see [#300](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/300)).
3. Due to the internal changes in PIT 1.7.0 ([#630](https://github.com/hcoles/pitest/pull/930)):
   - all history files should be deleted before upgrading
   - the names of the remove conditionals mutators have changed slightly (it might be needed to update their names in `build.gradle`, if activated explicitly)


## 1.6.0 - 2021-03-04

 - **Report aggregation for multi-project builds** - [#243](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/pull/243) - PR by [Mike Safonov](https://github.com/MikeSafonov)
 - Support new configuration property `testStrengthThreshold` (PIT 1.6.1+) - [#247](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/pull/247) - PR by [Michael Hönnig](https://github.com/mhoennig)
 - PIT 1.6.3 by default
 - Regression tests also with Gradle 7 (milestone)
 - Upgrade Gradle wrapper to 6.8.3
 - Remove deprecated `mutateStaticInits` and `includeJarFiles`

Sample configuration for the new report aggregation feature:

```groovy
//in root project configuration
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'info.solidsoft.gradle.pitest:gradle-pitest-plugin:...'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'info.solidsoft.pitest.aggregator' // to 'pitestReportAggregate' appear

subprojects {
    apply plugin: 'info.solidsoft.pitest'

    pitest {
        // export mutations.xml and line coverage for aggregation
        outputFormats = ["XML"]
        exportLineCoverage = true
        ...
    }
}
```

After the `pitest pitestReportAggregate` tasks execution, the aggregated report will be placed in the `${PROJECT_DIR}/build/reports/pitest` directory.


## 1.5.2 - 2020-08-18

 - Support java-test-fixtures plugin - [#223](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/pull/223) - PR by [Piotr Kubowicz](https://github.com/pkubowicz)
 - PIT 1.5.2 by default
 - Add functional test with Spock 2 (using JUnit Platform)
 - Bump minimal supported PIT version to 1.4.0 - the first version which required Java 8 (May 2018)
 - Upgrade Gradle wrapper to 6.6

## 1.5.1 - 2020-05-06

 - Fail with meaningful error message on no longer supported `pitest` configuration in `rootProject.buildscript` - [#205](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/205)

The only change helps people not reading the release notes to get know why their projects with the JUnit 5 PIT plugin stopped working after migration to 1.5.0+.

## 1.5.0 - 2020-04-28

 - Move `pitest` configuration from root project to current project to eliminate Gradle 6+ warning - [#62](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/62)
 - Upgrade Gradle wrapper to 6.3 (ability to build with Java 14)

**Compatibility changes**. This version finally relaxes the need to create `pitest` configuration in the root project. This was problematic especially with Android projects and also started to generate deprecation warnings in Gradle 6.

The migration steps are required only in project manually adding custom PIT plugins. For example:

```groovy
buildscript {   //only in gradle-pitest-plugin <1.5.0
    //...
    configurations.maybeCreate('pitest')
    dependencies {
        pitest 'org.example.pit.plugins:pitest-custom-plugin:0.42'
    }
}

pitest {
    testPlugin = 'custom'
    //...
}
```

should be replaced with:

```groovy
//only in gradle-pitest-plugin 1.5.0+

//in project (not buildscript) dependencies and without need to create "pitest" configuration manually
dependencies {
    pitest 'org.example.pit.plugins:pitest-custom-plugin:0.42'
}

pitest {
    testPlugin = 'custom'
    //...
}
```

Please also note that the users of the new JUnit 5 PIT plugin [configuration mechanism](https://blog.solidsoft.pl/2020/02/27/pit-junit-5-and-gradle-with-just-one-extra-line-of-configuration/#modern-improved-approach-with-plugins-br-and-gradle-pitest-plugin-147) with `junit5PluginVersion` are not affected.

## 1.4.9 - 2020-04-22

 - Fix regression in 1.4.8 related to missing source listing in PIT reports - [#198](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/198)
 - migrate remaining configuration properties to [Lazy Configuration API](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/lazy_configuration.html)
 - more corner cases tested

## 1.4.8 - 2020-04-01

 - Fix problem with setting `historyInputLocation` and `jvmPath` - [#189](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/189)
 - Less noisy "Adding dependency" logging - [#182](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/182)
 - PIT 1.5.1 by default (better Java 14 support)
 - Basic functional testing with Java 14
 - Validation with Java Gradle plugin - [#106](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/106) - PR by [Matthew Haughton](https://github.com/3flex)
 - CodeNarc code checks - [#184](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/pull/184) - PR by [Matthew Haughton](https://github.com/3flex)

## 1.4.7 - 2020-02-27

 - Simpler usage with JUnit 5 with `junit5PluginVersion` configuration parameter - [#177](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/177) - idea by [John Scancella](https://github.com/jscancella)
 - Remove deprecation warnings in Gradle 6 - [#155](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/155)
 - `additionalClasspathFile` no longer marked as `@OutputFile` for better Gradle 6+ compatibility
 - PIT 1.5.0 by default
 - Bump minimal Gradle version to 5.6 - required to fix deprecation warnings due to [#10953](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/10953)
 - Upgrade Gradle wrapper to 5.6.4

Starting with this release the configuration required to use PIT with JUnit 5 has been simplified to the following:

```
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'info.solidsoft.pitest' version '...'
}

pitest {
    //adds dependency to org.pitest:pitest-junit5-plugin and sets "testPlugin" to "junit5"
    junit5PluginVersion = '0.12'
}
```

See this [blog post](https://blog.solidsoft.pl/2020/02/27/pit-junit-5-and-gradle-with-just-one-extra-line-of-configuration/) for more details.

**Compatibility changes**. A new set of the configuration parameters (`jvmPath`, `historyInputLocation` and `historyOutputLocation`) has been converted from `File` to `RegularFileProperty` to prevent deprecation warnings in Gradle 6+. Gradle itself should handle those changes for configuration in `build.gradle`, however, there could be some corner cases if those fields were used directly.


## 1.4.6 - 2019-12-15

 - Support for includedTestMethods (PIT 1.3.2) - [#79](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/79)
 - Support for useClasspathJar (PIT 1.4.2) - [#92](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/92)
 - Support for skipFailingTests (PIT 1.4.4) - [#113](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/113)
 - Pass additional PIT features from command line with `--additionalFeatures` - [#139](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/139)
 - Set `targetTests` explicitly - [#144](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/144)
 - Ability to override `targetTests` from command line `--targetTests` - [#143](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/143)
 - Run `pitest` after `test` if both scheduled to run - [#141](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/pull/141) - PR by [Björn Kautler](https://github.com/Vampire)
 - Remove incubating `addFileExtensionsToFilter()` method added in 1.4.5 - suggestion by [Björn Kautler](https://github.com/Vampire)
 - Travis build with OpenJ9 11 - [#112](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/112)

**Compatibility changes**. The incubating `addFileExtensionsToFilter()` method added in 1.4.5 was removed as it is possible to achieve the same effect
(while waiting for [improvement in Gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/10475)) with:

```
pitest {
    fileExtensionsToFilter.addAll('xml', 'orbit')
}
```

## 1.4.5 - 2019-09-08

 - Rework internal plugin implementation to Gradle 5+ standards
 - PIT 1.4.10 by default
 - Basic Java 12 support tested by CI build
 - Move `pitest` task to `verification` group - [#136](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-pitest-plugin/issues/136) - PR by [Björn Kautler](https://github.com/Vampire)
 - Remove deprecation warnings in Gradle 6.0
 - Bump minimal Gradle version to 5.1
 - Meaningful error message on running unsupported Gradle version
 - Switch build to Gradle 5.6.1

**Known limitations**. This is a technical release to cope with the changes in Gradle 5 and 6. PIT 1.4.10 is used by default, but not all
new features of PIT 1.4.0+ have been implemented yet.

**Breaking changes**. This release changes internal implementation of the plugin configuration. The Gradle team worked hard to keep it as compatible
as possible, but not everything is supported. The new syntax can be [required](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/10475) for adding elements to
the file extensions to filter (`fileExtensionsToFilter`):

```
pitest {
    addFileExtensionsToFilter(['xml', 'orbit'])
}
```
There could be also some issues for people interacting with the plugin from custom code (instead of from `build.gradle`). As a side effect Gradle 5.1
(released in I 2019) is required.

## 1.4.0 - 2019-01-26

 - Basic Java 11 support verified with CI build (requires PIT 1.4.1+)- [#86](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/86), [#81](hhttps://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/81)
 - Improve `pitest` task caching with @Classpath - [#93](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/93)
 - PIT 1.4.3 by default
 - Switch build to Gradle 4.10.2
 - Remove support for Gradle <4.0 (for better Gradle 5 compatibility)
 - Remove deprecation warnings in Gradle 5.0
 - Enable automatic dependency bumping with [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/)

**Known limitations**. To reduce confusion on Java 11 support, this version provides PIT 1.4.3 by default which supports Java 11. However, not all
new features of PIT 1.4.0 to 1.4.3 have been implemented in this release of the Gradle plugin. They are planned to be added in the future versions.

## 1.3.0 - 2018-01-27

 - Support for test plugin selection in PIT (e.g. JUnit 5) - #76 - PR by [Christoph Sturm](https://github.com/christophsturm)
 - Support for excludedTestClasses parameter in PIT - #75
 - PIT 1.3.1 by default
 - Drop Java 7 support - #70
 - Basic Java 9 compatibility verified with CI build (preliminary support for Java 9 has been available since PIT 1.2.3) - #68
 - Switch build to Gradle 4.5

**Breaking change**. Starting with 1.3.0 binary artifacts require at least Java 8.

## 1.2.4 - 2017-11-14

 - Make dependency exclusion on classpath configurable - #53
 - PIT 1.2.4 by default
